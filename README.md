# Training CNNs on Blurred Images
Some code from my Summer 2019 research at the Computational Neuroscience Lab at Fordham University, under Dr. Daniel Leeds.
Precursor to [work I co-authored at the Vision Sciences Society Conference 2020](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2771800).

The goal of the research was to explore how CNNs could be made more robust on low-quality data, by answering the question of why infants have blurry vision--does it serve any purpose, and if so, can it be applied to CNNs?

These scripts I wrote show how data was blurred with different procedures, used to train multiple CNN architectures, and how they were tested and presented.

You will find these useful if you want examples of processing images and training and testing CNNs on them (especially using OpenCV and PyTorch).

Everything written in Python, PyTorch, and OpenCV.
