# Training CNNs on Blurred Images
Some code from my Summer 2019 research at the Computational Neuroscience Lab at Fordham University, under Dr. Daniel Leeds.
Precursor to work I co-authored at the Vision Sciences Society Conference 2020.

The goal of the research was to explore how CNNs could be made more robust on low-quality data, by answering the question of why infants have blurry vision--does it serve any purpose, and if so, can it be applied to CNNs?

These scripts I wrote show how data was blurred with different procedures, used to train multiple CNN architectures, and how they were tested and presented.

Everything written in Python and PyTorch.
